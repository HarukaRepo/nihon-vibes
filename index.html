                    The creation of anime theme songs involves collaboration between composers, lyricists, and singers.
                    This collaboration often results in works that blend various music genres and harness the power of
                    music to create something unique. Artists like <a

                    Bebop and Macross Plus, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiSA"><b>LiSA</b></a>, known for
                    her theme songs for Demon Slayer, have created music that has become synonymous with the anime they
